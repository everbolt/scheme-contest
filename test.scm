;;; Title: Buttabrot Probability Distribution
;;;
;;; Description:
;;;    The points that escape
;;;    From the Mandelbrot fractal
;;;    give us Buddabrot

;; State of each block is stored as a psudoarray in continuous memory to allow for constant access.
;; A psudoarray is one large interger where each $(bits) bits represents an element of the psudoarray.
;; Because python allows for arbitrarily large number this technique allows for an constant time random access of memory of any size.

;; This program takes a long time to run (many hours for small resolutions and large iterations)
;; I did a few other caluclations:

;; res=2 iterations=20: a couple minutes
;; https://ibb.co/XSC3H6k

;; res=2 iterations=100: 30 minutes
;; https://ibb.co/bdjVVBf

;; res=2 iterations=1000: 8 hours
;; https://ibb.co/hLrzbtK

;; res=2 iterations=2000: 21 hours
;; {Submited for contest}

;; res=1 iterations=1000: 24 hours
;; https://ibb.co/3hzvG18

;; res=2 iterations=1000 anti: 12 hours

; Define constants
(define res 2) ; Chnage this to change the how wide(pixels) each square is. This will change the runtime superquadratically.
(define iterations 2000) ; Change this to change the number of iterations. This will change the runtime subliniarly.
(define bits 16) ; How many bits each pixel is stored in. 16 should be good, unless res is very low and iterations is very high.
